# Topics in Data Algorithms [JS-ified]

A collection scripts written by me to practice and demonstrate certain topics important to data algorithms and structures. Merely for practice, but if it will help anybody then that is also great.

## Topics in this Repository:

* The "Traveling Salesman Problem", or TSP for short.
* "Finding Bridges in a Graph" via Depth-First-Search (or DFS) traversal

## Future Topics To Be Added:

* Detecting Cycles in a Directed Graph using DFS traversal
* Detecting Cycles in a Unidirectional Graph
